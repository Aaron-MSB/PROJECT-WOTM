# PROJECT-WOTM
A platform that enables teachers to curb burnout and lower attrition rate.

## Problem Statement
Globally teacher’s wellbeing and numbers are essential to the provision of effective quality education for all. Due to the fact that they support the education system through : facilitating and ensuring learning; promoting learner's wellbeing and proper administration at school; providing career guidance to learners and supporting learners development to become good citizens. However, there are high levels of teacher burnout and attrition cases which affects access to effective quality education. About half a million of U.S teachers leave the profession every year, with 66% of the nation’s best teachers continuing to leave the profession for careers elsewhere. This is even worse in other parts of the world, as nearly 50 percent of teachers consider quitting, naming stress as one of the primary reasons. Burnout is a problem within the teaching profession associated with emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment. Teachers confront disheartening experiences that can lead to fatigue, anxiety, and depression. When left unmanaged, these symptoms can result in teacher burnout.  These are exacerbated by covid 19 pandemic. Due to quarantining , virtual learning and social isolation that eliminated the opportunity for teachers and students to connect with their peers, socialize and express themselves.
Teacher burnout has been shown to have significant negative implications not only for teachers’ well-being in terms of their self-rated health, mental health, and job satisfaction. Also for students these include; reduced student's achievement and adjustment; poor student mental health and learner teacher interactions ; unwillingness to help students and poor delivery of lesson; reduced learner's motivation and increased student dropout due to limited guidance and support from teachers. In addition these effects negatively affect the entire communities’ wellbeing and development, due to reduced efficiency and effectiveness.
As teacher burnout and attrition have negative consequences at the individual teacher, student, organizational, and societal levels. Factors related to teacher burnout and attrition require more attention in order to increase access to quality education for all.

## Solution 
WOTM is a tool that equips teachers with social wellbeing actions, class planning material and motivational empowerment. It uses a strong artificial intelligence platform of IBM Watson and chatbots built on Watson Assistant. This technology will be widely adopted because it saves time and ensures automation in various aspects of support.
The user interfaces of the user (teacher) shall provide all necessary components to ensure that teachers get the best motivation while doing their work with less strain. The administrator part shall be used to interpret visualizations and profiles based on data gathered to produce meaningful information that can be used by planning agencies, Centers of emotional Intelligence on Teachers Affairs and Community based organizations to ensure that teachers and schools are well equipped to handle all students through their learning.
